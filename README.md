This is a monorepo using [Yarn
workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces#gatsby-focus-wrapper) and
[Zero-install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) to manage dependencies in different
packages.

## Get Started

To get started, running `yarn install` in the root of the project will install all of the
dependencies for you and you can simply `cd packages/<pkg>` and run the essentials scripts in each pacakge respectively.
